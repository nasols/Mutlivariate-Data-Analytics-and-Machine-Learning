    "Regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "We often denote the dependent variable as **response**, and the independent variables as **eplainatory variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often regression aims to be used in two problems. Firstly, prediction or forecasting, this includes the field of machine learning. Here we aim to model some problem given a set of data and then to use the model to do prediction.  \n",
    "Second are usecases where we want to deduce, or find causal relationships between the independent and dependent variable."

    "## Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we select a model we would like to estimate. Then we use some method, e.g. ordinary least squares, to estimate the parameters of that model. We can introduce following concepts: \n",
    "* Unknown parameters $\\beta$ or $\\theta$\n",
    "* Independent variables, often observed data, $X_i$\n",
    "* Dependent variables, observed in data, often the targets of our regression, $Y_i$\n",
    "* Error terms, these are not directly observed, however modeled or assumed to be from some distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these terms, we can formulate the general regression problem: \n",
    "$$Y_i = f(X_i, \\beta) + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the goal is to find the model f, fitting the targets, Y, best. To find this model we need to adjust the model parameters, $\\beta$, as to minimize the error of our predictions. "

    "\n",
    "Regression is just math, and to be reliable we depend on some assumptions for the results to have some information that actually represent the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The samples we collect are representative of the population \n",
    "* The independent variables are measured with no error \n",
    "* Deviations from the model have an expected value of zero, $E[\\epsilon_i | X_i] = 0$\n",
    "* The variance of the residuals, $e_i$ is constant across observations\n",
