    "### Factorial Design \n",
    "\n",
    "A factorial experiment is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors, each with discrete possible values or \"levels\", and whose experimental units take on all the possible compbinations of these levels. Such designs allows the investigator to study the effect of each factor to the response, as well as interactions between the variables' effect on the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "One major pro with factorial design over OVAT is that if a variable is much more important to the response than other variables, this is not captured in OVAT. Thus we need factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "One dissadvantage with factorial design is that the sample size needed grow exponentially with the number of factors. This is in general true for **full factorial designs** (as explained here), but are mitigated in other cases as **fractional factorial designs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest factorial experiments contains two levels for each of two factors. We often depict this as a cube (or hypercube) with the results of an experiment where the two factors at their respective level on the vertice. \n",

    "Given 2 factors with 2 levelse, we call this a 2x2 experiment, or $2^2$. In general:  $\\text{number levels}^{\\text{number factors}}$\n",
